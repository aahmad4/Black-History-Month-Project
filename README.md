# About The Project
For my sophomore year Black History Month Project, we were tasked with choosing an African American figure from the past and make a program dedicated towards giving information about him. I chose George Washington Carver and made a flipbook about him with Visual Basic.

# How To View The Program
Download all the contents of this repository, then open Black History Project (George Washington Carver).sln. This will show all the different forms and codes for each form in the project. Click on any form, then hit run.
